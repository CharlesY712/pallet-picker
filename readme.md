# Pallet Picker

## Description

There is a website out there called Coolors - and others like it are out there. They help you generate color palettes for websites or other design projects. This project aims to recreate some of this siteâ€™s functionality with my own backend and database. A user should be able to come to my site, generate a color palette, and save it for their own future projects.
